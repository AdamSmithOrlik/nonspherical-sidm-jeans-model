Descisions:
- Name: sidmhalo for the folder name and name in pyproject.toml 
    - easy to remember and easy to install and import 
- Moved initial_guess to data/ folder and refactored how it is called 
- Replaces the deprecated scipy.misc.derivitive 

TO DO LIST:
1. Add save and load functionlity -> DONE 
2. Fix the rotation curve code -> 
3. Add commented code and documentation -> 
4. Add simulation integration with Andrews data ->

- Remove findDiff from the package and hardcode the midpoint derivative 
- added save and load function in classes.py 
    - there are some problems here:
        - the squashed model's constructor logic in gen.py makes it hard to serialize the right q and Phi_b functions 
        - currently q and Phi_b are not loaded correctly...

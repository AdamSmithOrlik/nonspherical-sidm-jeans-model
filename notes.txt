Descisions:
- Name: sidmhalo for the folder name and name in pyproject.toml 
    - easy to remember and easy to install and import 
- Moved initial_guess to data/ folder and refactored how it is called 
- Replaces the deprecated scipy.misc.derivitive 

TO DO LIST:
1. Add save and load functionlity -> DONE
2. Fix the rotation curve code -> DONE 
3. Add commented code and documentation -> 
4. Add simulation integration with Andrews data -> DONE
5. Add Einasto profile to cdm.py file -> DONE
6. Work on optimising the code once in stable condition ->
7. Build units tests for the package -> 

TO DO LIST:
1. Finish commenting code 
2. Add documentation 
3. Add configuration file and CLI usage with data pipeline 
4. Optimize where possible (potentially run with pypy?)
5. Unit tests 


16/09/25
- Remove findDiff from the package and hardcode the midpoint derivative 
- added save and load function in classes.py 
    - there are some problems here:
        - the squashed model's constructor logic in gen.py makes it hard to serialize the right q and Phi_b functions 
        - currently q and Phi_b are not loaded correctly...

- adding comments to code and headers 
- need to add references to each file 
- clean up rotcurve.py file

17/09/25
- fixed the save/load functions with dill 
- added Andrews data to examples 
- working on simulation.py file and fit class to load the data in examples 
    - need to get finish writing the simulations file and test it
    - need to add to README how to get the data

18/09/25
- Work on simulation file 
- Add Einasto & gNFW profiles to Jeans code 
    - Didnt add gNFW yet... 
- finished simulations file 
- finished examples

19/09/25
- cdm is commented 

21/09/25
- added halo_type attribute to CDM_profile for NFW or Einasto

22/09/25
- Will need to add Sean's recent changes for the isothermal profile shape into the package...
- load inside the namespace
- seperate examples into multiple files notebooks
- 1 EAGLE data file on github as an example
- Change name to jeans
- add gNFW to the jeans package...

24/09/25
- updating code with recent changes made by Sean 
    - tools.py updted q_iso and q_baryon for squashed model 
- r_sph now taking a long time to run
- wrote run_jeans.py script, config file. Tested and it works. 

25/09/25
- moved save to gen.py so it is accedible via jeans.save(...)
- add scan feature to run_jeans.py

29/09/25
- update q_iso with Seans fixes - few things have changed, including gen.py file, classes too
- update the examples 
- fix non-constant q behaviour 
- verbose on times and output log files 
- check the central derivative and the new derivitive funciton on scipy.

02/10/25
to do list:
- combine the BSM and MW jeans models codes 
- comment the classes.py file 
- fix up the examples
- add small example files for exmaples 
- create documentation with sphinx 
- 

03/10/25
- updated code with Seans updates for q_iso
    - works, and runs much faster!
- added the q from force calculation to jeans code and tested

06/10/25
- make a test simulation hdf5 file with a few sysystems to save to the github 
- make shorter example notebooks 
- change alpha keyword to gamma because alpha is used for the non-constant shape power

- TODO: URGENT: add a summary about how the squashed model actually works...

20/10/25
- Sean mentioned that the velocity dependence is already built into the jeans code 
    - with the assumption that the dispersion is constant across the halo 
    - understand this, what does this means and how can we recover the 
    velocity dependent cross section (particle physics to astrophysics) 
- work on the bullet point summary of the squashed model following Andrews suggestions 
-

03/11/25
To do before adding to paper for submission 
- Add comments to the classes file
- Update the example notebooks into smaller files 
- keep a smaller version of the simulation data to use for examples 
- Update the README
- Add a keyword to activate the timed functions

- FIXES
    - check the nonconstant q issue DONE
    - spherical baryon potentials should be accepted without a wrapper 
    - switch alpha for Einasto profile to gamma 
    - create alpha keyword for the outer halo shape 

14/11/25
